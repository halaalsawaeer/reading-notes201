#HTML structure 
the webpage is like a regular printed document that we face every day.


attributes are used to give more information about the content of the element.
HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks, but this is not recommended.
we can see any codes of any webpage by click the right click of the mouse and clicking on the __view page source__
