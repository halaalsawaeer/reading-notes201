#HTML structure 
the webpage is like a regular printed document that we face every day.


attributes are used to give more information about the content of the element.
HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks, but this is not recommended.
we can see any codes of any webpage by click the right click of the mouse and clicking on the __view page source__
<iframe> is like a window in your webpage . it allows you to look into another page with the width and the height that you choose.
The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
<meta> gives information about the webpage.
  ##Escape charectars there are some charecters
  that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.) and to make them visable for the user we have to use some symbols. for example &#60 is used to show the left angled bracket.
 DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using. 
  The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page
  The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
  
  The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
