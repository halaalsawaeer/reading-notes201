#HTML structure 
the webpage is like a regular printed document that we face every day.


attributes are used to give more information about the content of the element.
HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks, but this is not recommended.
we can see any codes of any webpage by click the right click of the mouse and clicking on the __view page source__
iframe is like a window in your webpage . it allows you to look into another page with the width and the height that you choose.
The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
meta gives information about the webpage.
  ##Escape charectars there are some charecters
  that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.) and to make them visable for the user we have to use some symbols. for example &#60 is used to show the left angled bracket.
 DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using. 
  The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page
  The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
  
  The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
the aside element has two purposes that are depending on whether it is in the article elemnt or not .
if t is inside the article element it contain information about the article but not essential such as a grossery about the the article.
if it is outside the article it acts as a container for a content that is related to the whole site.
The section element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
the figure element t can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article
 such as : ● Images
● Videos
● Graphs
● Diagrams
● Code samples
● Text that supports the main
body of an article
The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
 it reduces the use of div element
  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
  To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
  A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require
  Good navigation tends to follow these principles : Concise,Clear,selective,Context, Interactive and Consistent.
   It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them
  JAVASCRIPT allows you to make webpages more interactive.
  You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them
  PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. 
  
REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred.

EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT
IN THE BROWSER 
:
1.SLIDESHOWS  2.FORMS 3.RELOAD PART OF PAGE 4.FILTERING DATA 
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

objects :each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object
proparites : they are the characteristics of the objects
events : used to trigger a specific section of the code
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. 
HOW A BROWSER
SEES A WEB PAGE
 1: RECEIVE A PAGE AS
HTML CODE 
2: CREATE A MODEL OF
THE PAGE AND STORE
IT IN MEMORY
3. 3: USE A RENDERING
ENGINE TO SHOW THE
PAGE ON SCREEN 

The HTML script element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
