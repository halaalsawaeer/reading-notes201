Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem
A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem

As you can see, methods can be added to a constructor function's prototype. Think of the prototype as an object's stunt double. Whenever a scene is too dangerous, you can substitute in the prototype to do the work while the object takes all the glory. More on how that works below.

Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

There are several types of information
that need to be displayed in a grid or
table. For example: sports results, stock
reports, train timetables.

The table element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

tr
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening tr tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
td elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing tr tag.
td
Each cell of a table is
represented using a td
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing td tag.

The th element is used just
like the td element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.) 

thead
The headings of the table should
sit inside the thead element.
tbody
The body should sit inside the
tbody element.
tfoot
The footer belongs inside the
tfoot element.
you can update the properites of an object using dot.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. 

The this keyword is used instead of the object
name to indicate that the property or method
belongs to the object that this function creates. 

Each statement that creates a new property or
method for this object ends in a semicolon (not a
comma, which is used in the literal syntax). 

In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key. 

array is a special type of object.

Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 

The window object represents the current
browser window or tab. It is the topmost object
in the Browser Object Model, and it contains
other objects that tell you about the browser. 

The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the
document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current
browser window or tab.

In JavaScript there are six data types:
Five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types.
The sixth is the object (and is referred to as a complex data type). 

In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
