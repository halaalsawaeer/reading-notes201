(allowing text to flow around its
left-hand side).

surrounding text with the top of
the image.

web professionals is Adobe
Photoshop. (In fact, professional
web designers often use this
software to design entire sites.) 

image formats :

Whenever you have many different
colors in a picture you should use a JPEG. such as photographs



Use GIF or PNG format
when saving images
with few colors or large
areas of the same color.
 
  Logos, illustrations, and diagrams
often use flat colors (GIF)

When cropping images it is important not to
lose valuable information. 

 The
resolution of an image is the
number of squares that fit within
a 1 inch x 1 inch square area.

Images appearing on computer
screens are made of tiny squares
called pixels.

Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi.

JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to
a type of image format known
as bitmap

Vector images differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator.

Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

 figure element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated. 

The figcaption element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.


The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
 hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan


Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Saturation refers to the amount
of gray in a color

Brightness (or "value") refers
to how much black is in a color. 

It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

Hue is the colloquial idea of
color.

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.


The font weight not only adds
emphasis but can also affect
the amount of white space and
contrast on a page.

Oblique
font styles take the normal style
and put it on an angle.

Serif fonts have extra details on
the end of the main strokes of
the letters

Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters and therefore
have a much cleaner design

Monospace
Every letter in a monospace
typeface is the same width. 

Cursive fonts either have
joining strokes or other cursive
characteristics, such as
handwriting styles.

Fantasy fonts are usually
decorative fonts and are often
used for titles. They're not
